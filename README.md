# Vault Thread Simulator

Flask app that uses markov chains to simulate posts in the awesomenauts vault threads.

### TODO
* Add images to chain.
  - Currently images are being striped out. We need to add them to the scraper and replace them with a placeholder text that includes the url.
* CTRL+F FIXME, fix it.

I most likely won't do any of the TODOs unless I get bored again :P
